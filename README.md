I created a project titled "Periodic Table" using only HTML. This project presents the periodic table of elements in a structured and visually accessible manner. Each element is represented in a grid layout, displaying its symbol, atomic number, and other key information. The project showcases my ability to use semantic HTML to organize and represent data effectively, adhering to standards for accessibility and clarity. This simple yet educational project serves as a foundational example of how HTML alone can be used to create informative and well-structured web pages.
